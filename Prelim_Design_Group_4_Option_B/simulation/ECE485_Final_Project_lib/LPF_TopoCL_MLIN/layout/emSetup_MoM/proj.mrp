Using the minimal snap distance of 0.0004 mm
(4 layout resolution points) for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.0001 mm.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
TML calibration for port "P1" has been changed
to TML (zero length) calibration because the
transmission line of pin "P1" would otherwise
intersect with the layout.
